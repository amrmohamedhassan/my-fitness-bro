The key is coating the lemon chicken with lots of moisture-giving things, and watching that internal temp closely so that you don’t over-bake the chicken.\r\n\r\nMake a lemon chicken marinade. Well, it’s really more like a rub or a paste, because our lemon chicken recipe requires no actual marinating (yay!). But basically, we coat the chicken breasts in a thick, olive oil-based herb paste flavored with oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\r\nMake the lemon chicken sauce! Stir together all of the zingy things—white vinegar, fresh garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice—to make the sauce that the chicken breasts will bake in. You’ll also use this sauce to baste the chicken as it bakes, ensuring that these bright flavors have a chance to be absorbed by the chicken (without having to actually marinate the chicken).\r\nBake! Until you get that internal temperature reading of 165°F. Then it’s time to dig in!",

Place breadcrumbs in another shallow dish. Dip eggplant slices in the egg and then dredge in the breadcrumbs to coat thoroughly; transfer to a plate.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half the eggplant slices and cook until browned on the first side, about 2 minutes. Turn the slices, add 1 teaspoon oil and reduce heat to medium; cook until browned on the second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked eggplant to the prepared baking dish. Repeat with the remaining oil and eggplant; transfer the cooked slices back to the plate.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nWipe out the pan; add tomato sauce and salt, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in basil. Pour half the sauce over the eggplant in the baking dish. Sprinkle with half the cheese. Layer on the remaining eggplant. Top with the remaining sauce.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nCover the baking dish with foil. Bake until bubbling, about 10 minutes. Remove the foil, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and continue baking until the cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.",
